# Python program to implement a example of virtual asistent (Alicia) based con ChatGPT
# The interaction with virtual asistant is performed by audio and voice recognition of the user
# and asistant's answers are audio speech
# this code was wrote and tested by: Camilo Duque - camilo.duque@tec.mx
# from examples code of openai, speech_recognition and pyttsx3 API
